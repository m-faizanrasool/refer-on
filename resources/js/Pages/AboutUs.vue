                We are an innovative community referral code platform that
                connects users across a wide range of products and services. Our
                mission is to simplify the referral process for users and create
                a community-driven ecosystem of rewards and benefits.
            </p>

            <p>
                As users ourselves, we often faced challenges in the supposedly
                simple tasks of being referred and referring – Where do we find
                the referral codes? And who do we then send the referral codes
                to?
            </p>

            <p>These challenges gave rise to the idea of Referon.</p>

            <p>
                At Referon, users can easily search for and share referral codes
                with one another. Upon signing up, users gain access to our
                extensive library of referral codes and can find ones that align
                with their interests. By using these codes, users can unlock
                rewards, discounts, cashback, points, or any other incentives
                offered by the merchants and brands.
            </p>

            <p>
                The benefits of Referon don't stop there. Our platform is
                uniquely designed to foster a positive cycle of referrals that
                benefits everyone in the community. Once a user has used a
                referral code and enjoyed its rewards, Referon will display his
                own referral code to set up the next referral. This cycle
                creates a win-win situation where everyone, from the merchants
                to the users, benefits twice.
            </p>

            <p class="!mb-10">
                We are committed to creating a seamless and enjoyable community
                experience for our users. By simplifying the referral process
                and fostering a sense of community among users, we hope to make
                Referon the go-to platform for finding and sharing referral
                codes.

            <h6>FAQ</h6>

            <h6>How does it work?</h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Simply key in the brand/merchant name to search for its
                    referral code.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Use the referral code provided by Referon to sign
                    up/purchase with the brand/merchant. Once you have signed
                    up/purchased, click “Proceed to fulfil”.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Then you can submit your own referral code to Referon for
                    the next user to use.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In summary, User A refers User B (you), and User B refers
                    User C. Referon!
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Whose referral code is Referon presenting to me?</h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The referral code that we present to you is that of another
                    member of the Referon community. He has used the referral
                    code of another user and then submitted his own code to
                    Referon.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>
                Can I not use the referral code that Referon presents to me? I
                just want to submit my code only.
            </h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    No. Using the referral code that Referon provides is
                    essential for the Referon community to function correctly.
                    We help one another in the fulfilment of the referral codes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    We have a demerit system in place to penalise users who
                    violate our Terms by submitting an invalid referral code.
                    These accounts shall be suspended or even terminated.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>
                The referral code from Referon cannot be used. What do I do?
            </h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click on "Report invalid code" to inform us of the issue.
                    The user who submitted the invalid referral code will
                    receive one demerit point. Please keep a
                    screenshot/documentary proof of the issue.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>
                I have used a referral code from Referon and then submitted my
                own code. How do I track when my referral code is used?
            </h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Track your referral code under “Account Details” in the “My
                    Account” section. Look under Status:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            “Pending execution by next user” means that your
                            referral code has been posted on Referon and it will
                            be presented for the next user to use.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            “Pending verification” means that your referral code
                            has been used by the next user and is waiting for
                            your verification. You should verify with the
                            relevant brand/store that the code has been used.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Choose “Verified” or “Disputed” to confirm or
                            dispute that your referral code has been used. If
                            you choose “Disputed”, the other user will receive
                            one demerit point. Please keep a
                            screenshot/documentary proof of the issue.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h6>What rewards do I get?</h6>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the brand/merchant offers dual rewards for the referrer
                    and the referee (most of them do), you will get both
                    rewards!
